# xmaps_app

A Maps test application for learning purposes. Made based on the Flutter Advanced course of Fernando Herrera.

- BLoC pattern design and project organization using clean code practices. 
- We covered Maps APIs for both iOS and Android platform. 
- Permissions management for both platforms.
- Location and realtime.
- Linter configuration.
- Map custom design. 
- Markers custom design.
